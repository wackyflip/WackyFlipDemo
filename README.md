# WackyFlipDemo
A web-based game demo inspired by [Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.org), featuring ragdoll physics, parkour-style flipping, and score-based challenges. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and p5.js, this project simulates the thrill of performing flips and landing on targets in a 2D urban environment. Perfect for developers learning game physics or fans wanting to explore Wacky Flip’s mechanics.

## Features
* **Ragdoll Physics Simulation**: Uses p5.js to mimic dynamic flips and falls, inspired by Wacky Flip’s unpredictable stunts.
* **Single Urban Environment**: A 2D "Construction Site" with platforms and targets for jumping and landing.
* **Combo Tricks System**: Perform basic flips (e.g., Single Flip, Double Flip) with score multipliers.
* **Score Tracking**: Earn points for landing accuracy and combo complexity.
* **Responsive Controls**: Mouse or touch inputs for charging jumps, flipping, and landing.
* **Arcade Mode Prototype**: Endless flipping with randomized targets for practice.
## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
* A local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) to run the game due to p5.js file loading.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WackyFlipDemo.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd WackyFlipDemo
3. Open index.html in a browser via a local server (e.g., npx live-server).
How to Play
1. Charge Jump: Hold the left mouse button or tap to charge jump power.
2. Launch: Release to jump into the air.
3. Flip: Click/tap mid-air to perform a flip (up to 2 rotations).
4. Land: Release mid-air to stop flipping and align for landing.
5. Score: Land on the target to earn points—center landings and multiple flips boost your score.

_Controls are optimized for desktop and mobile. Practice in Arcade Mode to master flips!_
## Roadmap
* Add 3 more environments (Baseball Court, Front Yard, Playground).
* Implement advanced combo tricks (Pike, Scissor, etc.).
* Introduce leaderboards using a backend API.
* Enhance ragdoll physics with Matter.js for more realism.
* Add sound effects and animations for jumps and landings.
